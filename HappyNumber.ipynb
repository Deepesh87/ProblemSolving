    "For a number with 33 digits, it's impossible for it to ever go larger than 243243. This means it will have to either get stuck in a cycle below 243243 or go down to 11. Numbers with 44 or more digits will always lose a digit at each step until they are down to 33 digits. So we know that at worst, the algorithm might cycle around all the numbers under 243243 and then go back to one it's already been to (a cycle) or go to 11. But it won't go on indefinitely, allowing us to rule out the 3rd option.\n",
